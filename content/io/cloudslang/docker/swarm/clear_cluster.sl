# Deletes all Docker images and containers from a Docker Swarm cluster.
#
# Inputs:
#   - swarm_manager_ip - IP address of the machine with the Swarm manager container
#   - swarm_manager_port - port used by the Swarm manager container
#   - excluded_images - optional - containers based on these images will not be deleted
#                                - used for filtering out containers used by Swarm e.g. agent containers
#                     - Default: swarm:latest
#   - host - Docker machine host
#   - port - optional - SSH port
#   - username - Docker machine username
#   - password - optional - Docker machine password
#   - private_key_file - optional - path to private key file
#   - character_set - optional - character encoding used for input stream encoding from target machine - Valid: SJIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8
#   - pty - optional - whether to use PTY - Valid: true, false
#   - timeout - optional - time in milliseconds to wait for the command to complete
#   - close_session - optional - if false SSH session will be cached for future calls during the life of the flow, if true the SSH session used will be closed; Valid: true, false
#   - agent_forwarding - optional - whether to forward the user authentication agent
# Outputs:
#   - amount_of_images_deleted - how many images (not including dangling) were deleted
#   - amount_of_dangling_images_deleted - how many dangling images were deleted
#   - total_amount_of_images_deleted - how many images (including dangling) were deleted
# Results:
#   - SUCCESS - successful
#   - FAILURE - otherwise
