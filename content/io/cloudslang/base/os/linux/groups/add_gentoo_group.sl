# This flow performs a linux command to add a specified group named <group_name> on machines that are running Gentoo
#
# Inputs:
#   - host - hostname or IP address
#   - root_password - the root password
#   - group_name - the group name where to be added
#
# Outputs:
#   - return_result - STDOUT of the remote machine in case of success or the cause of the error in case of exception
#   - standard_out - STDOUT of the machine in case of successful request, null otherwise
#   - standard_err - STDERR of the machine in case of successful request, null otherwise
#   - exception - contains the stack trace in case of an exception
#   - command_return_code - The return code of the remote command corresponding to the SSH channel. The return code is
#                           only available for certain types of channels, and only after the channel was closed
#                           (more exactly, just before the channel is closed).
#	                        Examples: 0 for a successful command, -1 if the command was not yet terminated (or this
#                                     channel type has no command), 126 if the command cannot execute.
# Results:
#    - SUCCESS - add group SSH command was successfully executed
#    - FAILURE - otherwise
