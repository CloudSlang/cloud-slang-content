# Adds or replaces a value to the given JSON at the keys or indices represented by the json_path.
# If the last key in the path does not exist, the key is added as well.
#
# Inputs:
#   - json_input - JSON data input
#   - json_path - path at which to add value represented as a list of keys and/or indices - Example: ['tags', 1, 'name']
#   - value - value to associate with key
# Outputs:
#   - json_output - JSON with keys:value added
#   - return_result - parsing was successful or not
#   - return_code - "0" if parsing was successful, "-1" otherwise
#   - error_message - error message if there was an error when executing, empty otherwise
# Results:
#   - SUCCESS - parsing was successful (return_code == '0') and value was added
#   - FAILURE - parsing was unsuccessful or the path does not exist
