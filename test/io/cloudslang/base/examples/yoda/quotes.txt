May the Force be with you;
You will find only what you bring in;
Size matters not;
Do or do not. There is no try;
The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side;
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is;
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice;
You must unlearn what you have learned;
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way;
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose;
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering;
Always pass on what you have learned;
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night;
